RoverWing requires a 7-14V power source, typically a battery. The choice of
the battery depends on what chassis and motors
you are using. In most situations, the easiest and cheapest choice is a 2- or 3-cell LiPo
battery such as
`this one <https://www.amazon.com/5200mAh-Battery-HardCase-Traxxas-Associated/dp/B07L68892D>`__.
You can also use a NiMH battery or even a battery pack of 6 regular or
rechargable AA batteries. (Unfortunately, you can not use a 4-pack of AA
batteries -- the voltage would be too low. )


Look for a battery with an XT60 connector; this avoids the need for a separate
adapter.
