Below is the list of suggested cables and places to buy them.

* **Power and motor cables**. RoverWing uses JST VH connectors. You can buy
  JST VH 2-pin cables from many sources, including

  - `REV Robotics <http://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/electronics/cables>`__
    (JST VH - JST VH, JST VH to Anderson PowerPole).
  - `ServoCity <https://www.servocity.com/electronics/wiring/adaptors`__
  - Amazon, eBay, AliExpress

* **Encoders, Sonars, I2C**. RoverWing uses JST PH 4pin connectors for all of
  these ports. For the encoders, the pin order matches the one used by REV
  Robotics hub, so if you are using REV Robotics motors, you can
  directly connect the encoders using a JST PH - JST PH cable, which can be
  bought from `REV Robotics <http://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/electronics/cables>`__
  For other peripherals, you can use JST PH - female headers cable from Adafruit:
  https://www.adafruit.com/product/3950
  You can also use SEEED Studio `Grove cables <https://www.seeedstudio.com/cables-c-949.html>`__,
  available from `Arrow <https://www.arrow.com/en/products/110990031/seeed-technology-limited>`_.
  The contacts and spacing are identical, but the plastic housing of Grove cable
  does not completely fit in the PH4 connector, so the fit will not be perfect -
  but good enough for a solid electrical connection.

* **Neopixel**. Roverwing uses JST PH 3-pin connector for the NeoPixel port.
  This is the same connector and same pin order as used by Adafruit Hallowing. You
  can plug in a Neopixel strip such as this one from Adafruit directly:
  https://www.adafruit.com/product/3919 or you can use the JST ph3 to female
  socket adapter cable such as `this one <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3894>`_.
