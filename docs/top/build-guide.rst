===========================

(Work in progress - at the moment it is just a draft).

Parts included
--------------

* RoverWing Top PCB with components soldered
* Switch and switch cover
* Male headers (21 mm), 12 pin and 16 pin
* Standoffs: four 25-mm m3 plastic standoffs, four 6mm m3 standoffs, nuts and
  screws


Assembly steps
--------------

.. warning::
   Before beginning the assembly process, disconnect the battery from the
   RoverWing. You should also disconnect the
   battery every time you are removing the RoverWing Top.



1. Take the XT30-XT60 power cable which comes with RoverWing and cut the **red**
   wire about 5cm (2in) away from the XT30 connector. Strip about 5mm (slightly
   less than 1/4") of wire on both sides oof the cut.

2. Tightly twist the stripped wire, insert in the  holes in the switch terminals,
   and solder, as shown in the photo below. Please pay attention to details:
   which side of wire goes into each terminal and from which direction. Use
   diagonal cutters to cut away ends of the wire protruding from the terminal.
