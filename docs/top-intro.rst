RoverWing top is an optional accessory for the RoverWing, which provides a
power switch, small  prototyping area, three NeoPixel LEDs, buttons, and a 3 line
OLED display.

If you ordered RoverWing Top as part of RoverWing  CrowdSupply campaign, it
will need some assembly, requiring basic soldering skills. This is  documented
in detail in :ref:`top-build-guide`.
