RoverWing has the same dimensions as Adafruit CRICKIT board: it is an octagon
inscribed in the circle of 3.5" (about 89mm) diameter. It has 8 mounting holes,
which can accept M3 or #4-40 screws (you do not really need all 8 - mounting it
using just 4 standoffs should be more than enough). Detailed dimensions are
shown in the drawing below.

.. warning::
   The board is not a regular octagon: it has 90 degree rotational symmetry
   but not 45 degree.
